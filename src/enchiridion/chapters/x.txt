On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember
to turn to yourelf and inquire what power you have for turning it to
use. If you see a fair main or a fair woman, you will find the power
to resist is temperance (continence). If labor (pain) be presented to
you, you will find that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you
will find that it to be patience. And if you have been thus formed to
the (proper) habit, the appearance will not carry you along with
them.
