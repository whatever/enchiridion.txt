You can be invincible, if you enter into no contest in
which it it not in your pwer to conquer. Take care
then when you observe a man honored before others
or possessed of great power or highly esteemed for
any reason, not to suppose him happy, and be not
carried away by the appearance. For if the nature of
the good is inourpwer neither envy nor jealousy
will have a place in us. But you yourself will not wish
to be a general or senator or consul, but a free man:
and there is only way to this, to despise (care not
for) the things which are not in our power.
